 * Pure view-model mapping for the Registry detail view's Revisions panel

 *
 * Both wire operations type their output `unknown` (the generated client's
 * `weft.workflows.revisions.list`/`weft.workflows.active.get` entries —
 * their zod schemas use `z.unknown()`, same as the registry snapshot), so
 * every record is runtime-guarded rather than cast. `workflowRevisionRows`
 * treats even one malformed entry as a malformed RESPONSE (returns
 * `undefined`) rather than silently dropping just that entry — see that
 * function's own doc for why a partial, silently-filtered list is unsafe
 * here specifically.

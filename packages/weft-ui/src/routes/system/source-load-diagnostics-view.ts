/**
 * Pure view-model mapping for per-`(name, revision)` dynamic-source load
 * diagnostics (WFT-116): turns `weft.catalog.diagnostics`' output into
 * render-ready rows. Framework-free and unit-testable without a DOM,
 * mirroring `registry-view.ts`/`workflow-revisions-view.ts`.
 *
 * ## What Weft actually exposes, and what it doesn't
 *
 * `weft.catalog.diagnostics` (`system:read`) answers for ONE `(name,
 * revision)` key. Its `source` block is present only when `name` has ever
 * been `engine.registerSource()`-registered in the serving process — for a
 * purely eager `engine.register()` workflow it is absent, which this module
 * reports as an explicit {@link SourceLoadSummary} of kind `'not-dynamic'`
 * rather than an empty/ambiguous render.
 *
 * There is deliberately no local re-derivation of any of it: `state`,
 * `loadDurationMs`, `waiterCount`, and `lastFailureCategory` are read
 * verbatim off the wire. The console never imports Weft's source-runtime
 * internals (`core/engine/source-runtime-state.ts` is server-only), so the
 * two closed unions below are hand-declared mirrors of
 * `SourceLoadState`/`FailureCategory` — the same browser-bundle constraint
 * `compatibility-verdict.ts`' `KNOWN_COMPATIBILITY_REASONS` documents.
 *
 * ## No enumeration, and therefore no list
 *
 * Weft publishes no operation that enumerates `registerSource()`-registered
 * names or revisions, and `weft.system.registry` is built from
 * `internals.registrations` only — a dynamic-source name never appears in
 * it, not even after a successful preload installs a revision durably. So a
 * caller can only ask about a key it already holds (filed upstream as
 * WFT-165). See `dynamic-source-panel.svelte`'s module doc for how the two
 * console surfaces divide that constraint between them.

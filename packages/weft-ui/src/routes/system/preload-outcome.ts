/**
 * Preload-outcome presentation (WFT-116): turns the wire outcome of
 * `weft.workflows.revisions.preload` into text an operator can act on.
 *
 * `weft.workflows.revisions.preload` (`workflows:admin`) loads, validates,
 * and installs one `engine.registerSource()`-registered `(name, revision)`
 * durably into the workflow catalog. It resolves with the installed
 * `WorkflowRevisionRecord`, or faults with one of a bounded set this module
 * enumerates exhaustively from the server's own mapping
 * (`preload-workflow-revision.ts` plus `workflow-catalog-operation-helpers.ts`'s
 * `throwWorkflowCatalogOperationFault`, both verified against the published
 * `@lostgradient/weft` 0.25.0 tree):
 *
 * - `NotFound` + `data.resource: 'workflow-source'` — nothing was ever
 *   `registerSource()`-registered under this exact `(name, revision)` key.
 * - `NotFound` + `data.resource: 'workflow-revision'` — the revision is not
 *   installed (`WorkflowRevisionNotInstalledError`).
 * - `Conflict` + `data.reason: 'load-failed'` — the loader threw, or the
 *   source was otherwise unavailable. The server deliberately never
 *   forwards the loader's own message (it can carry a filesystem path or a
 *   credentialed URL); the classified cause is observable instead through
 *   `weft.catalog.diagnostics`' `source.lastFailureCategory`, which is
 *   exactly why the panel re-fetches diagnostics after a failed preload.
 * - `Conflict` + `data.reason: 'validation-failed'` + `sourceValidationReasons`
 *   — the module loaded but failed `validateResolvedWorkflowSource()`; the
 *   bounded reason list is rendered verbatim.
 * - `Conflict` + `data.reason: 'ambiguous-revision'` — two or more
 *   registered revisions matched and the engine refused to guess.
 * - `Conflict` + `data.reason: 'catalog-conflict'` — a durable catalog
 *   conflict (`WorkflowCatalogConflictError`).
 * - `Conflict` + `data.reason` of `'not-registered' | 'legacy-ambiguous' |
 *   'not-installed'` — `WorkflowRevisionUnavailableError` (WFT-21), which
 *   `runSharedSourceLoad()` throws directly for a tombstoned revision.
 * - `InvalidParams` — a malformed `name`/`revision`, rejected before any
 *   load is attempted.
 *
 * Like `compatibility-verdict.ts`, this module never reimplements any of
 * that server-side logic; it only labels what comes back. The reason
 * literals below are hand-declared mirrors of closed unions that live in
 * server-only modules — a VALUE import from the package root would pull
 * Weft's server module graph into the browser bundle (see
 * `../../lib/faults.ts`'s module doc).

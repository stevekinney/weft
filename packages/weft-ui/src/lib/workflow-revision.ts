/**
 * Shared workflow-revision vocabulary (WFT-117): the `WorkflowCatalogActivePointer`-like
 * type/guard, the active-pointer fetch, and the classifier that compares a
 * persisted run's `revision` against the catalog's currently active one.
 * Consumed by both `routes/workflows/*` (this batch) and `routes/system/
 * workflow-revisions-view.ts` (WFT-115, which re-imports the type/guard from
 * here rather than defining its own — see that module).
 *
 * Lives in `src/lib` rather than either route so neither `routes/workflows`
 * nor `routes/system` cross-imports the other's route-chunked bundle — this
 * repo's routes otherwise never import from a sibling route's `.ts` files
 * (verified by grep across the existing tree).
 *
 * ## Why `fetchActiveWorkflowRevision` throws on a malformed body instead of
 * returning `null`
 *
 * `weft.workflows.active.get` faults `NotFound` for a workflow that has
 * never been activated — a legitimate `null` result, not an error (see the
 * call site's catch below, mirroring `workflow-revisions-panel.svelte`'s
 * identical handling). A SUCCESSFUL response that fails
 * {@link isWorkflowCatalogActivePointerLike} is a different situation
 * entirely and must not collapse to the same `null`: a caller reading `null`
 * cannot tell "never activated" from "the server sent something this
 * console can't parse," and `workflowRevisionRows`'s own doc explains why
 * conflating the two is unsafe specifically for this operation. Throwing a
 * `HttpClientError` (rather than a plain `Error`) matters too — `classifyFault`
 * (`./faults.ts`) only recognizes `HttpClientError`, and `shouldRetryQuery`
 * (`./query.ts`) treats anything ELSE as network-transient and retries it
 * three times with backoff before a caller ever sees "unknown." `Unprocessable`
 * maps to the non-retrying `invalid` treatment, so callers render the
 * "unknown" state immediately instead of stalling on pointless retries of a
 * response that will never change shape on refetch.
